                <h1>Zions National Park</h1>
                <p>Located in Southern Utah, Zion National Park attracts visitors
                    looking to nourish their souls with the sight of the verdant valleys and vermillion cliffs. It is
                    one of the most visited national parks in the United States.
                </p>

                <p>Get the most of your time in Zion by doing homework and figuring out what goals you have while
                    visiting the park. Be realistic about the time it will take to complete your list by considering
                    delays due to crowds. Be clear about your own physical limitations and don’t push yourself to
                    exhaustion — there are plenty of strenuous hikes, canyoneering routes and other activities that can
                    wear out even the fittest person. Recognizing these challenges will make your trip more memorable
                    for all the right reasons. Don’t let poor shoes, sunburn or dehydration ruin your long-planned
                    adventure.</p>

                <p>Scheduling on the safe side of time allowed, rather than the short side, will make the experience
                    more relaxing for you and other visitors in the park. Being in Zion should not be rushing about
                    trying to complete every trail in the park. It took eons for the place to be created. Take time to
                    reflect on the intricate mysteries of Zion and you may learn a little about yourself and those with
                    you on the journey. (visitutah.com)</p>

                <h1>Rainbow Bridge National Monument</h1>
                <p>Considered sacred in Navajo culture, Rainbow Bridge is a symbol of deities responsible for creating
                    rain, the essence of life in the desert. Before the construction of Glen Canyon Dam formed Lake
                    Powell, Rainbow Bridge National Monument was a remote destination requiring a multi-day hike from
                    Navajo Mountain. Now, Lake Powell water level brings visitors within one-quarter to 2 miles of
                    Rainbow Bridge, yet this impressive Utah natural bridge still feels a world apart.</p>
                <p>Rainbow Bridge National Monument is the <strong>tallest natural bridge in the world</strong>. It is
                    roughly the sixth
                    longest. Carved from red Navajo sandstone, the bridge is 290 feet tall and 270 feet across — higher
                    than the United States Capitol Building — and nearly as long as a football or soccer field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rising up at the mouth of Bridge Canyon, in a cove on Lake Powell, you can reach the bridge by
                    personal boats and watercraft, or boat cruises offered daily from Halls Crossing or Bullfrog Marinas
                    north of <strong>Glen Canyon National Recreation Area</strong> or <strong>Wahweap Marina</strong>
                    near the Arizona border. On your
                    cruise, you'll navigate among miles of Lake Powell's curiously sculpted slickrock shores, high up in
                    Glen Canyon. There is no question as to the erosive power of water. Yet water sometimes carves with
                    whimsy and precision. In this way, Rainbow Bridge is more than a symbol of life in the desert — it
                    is the desert come alive. (visitutah.com)

                <h1>Bryce Canyon National Park</h1>
                <p>At dawn and dusk, mule deer graze the forested plateau along the road into Bryce Canyon. The alpine
                    environment is home to dozens of species of mammals and birds, all acquainted with a spectacular
                    truth: this is no ordinary forest. Water and wind over millions of years of freezes and thaws have
                    carved into the plateau endless fields of the park's distinctive red rock pillars, called hoodoos,
                    into the park's series of natural amphitheaters. Seek out the canyon floor on foot or stick to the
                    overlooks by car. Bryce Canyon National Park invites discovery.</p>

                <p>Every year, Bryce Canyon National Park awes visitors with spectacular geological formations and
                    brilliant colors. The towering hoodoos, narrow fins, and natural bridges seem to deny all reason or
                    explanation, leaving hikers gazing around with jaws agape in wondrous incredulity. This surreal
                    landscape is what brings people from around the world to visit Bryce Canyon National Park.
